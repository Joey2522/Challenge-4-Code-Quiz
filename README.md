# Challenge-4-Code-Quiz
This repo contains the documents for my UT Bootcamp Challenge # 4-Web APIs: Code Quiz.

## Description
This weeks bootcamp challenge was to create a JavaScript code quiz from scratch. Speaking of scratching that is how I began this challenge, scratching my head. JavaScrip has been very challenging for me. I am understanding a few concepts and methods but putting them into practice has been a little overwhelming. I did a google search for how to create a web based multiple choice quiz. I found someone online who created the exact quiz I was trying to make (see link to that code below). I printed out the example code and disected it line by line. I was able to learn SO MUCH by maping out the code and typing it in as I went. I also learned a lot because I had a lot of typos and things did not work until I found the spelling error or missing comma. There are still many things that I don't quite understand and I am told this is normal for this stage in the bootcamp.


## Functionality
This quiz should begin when you click the start button. Once the quize begins you will be giving 60 seconds to finish the quiz. There are 7 JavaScript questions and every wrong answer you choose you will have 10 seconds deducted from your remaining time. At the end of the quiz you will be prompted to enter your name. After you enter you name you can see your score listed with any other scores that have been stored. You can choose to go back and take the quiz again to try and beat your score from the previous try.
